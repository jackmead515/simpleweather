React-Native Weather Application

## About
This is just an app I built as part of a job interview. The details were given to me that it has to display the weather with some 
basic UX/UI design requirements. I rest was up too me.

I was really nervous and excited about this challenge because I had absolutely no knowledge of React-Native at the time with
only a basic understanding of React.

I studied React and React-Native after I got off work up late into the night (somedays at midnight or so). I had a time restrain of two weeks, but it ended up taking me just over a week to complete.

Very interesting challenge! Even though I quit the job shortly after (because I loathed the position), it taught me a lot about what it means to work hard on something which is completely new to you and are given a time constraint.

## To build

Edit local.properties in android/local.properties to point to android sdk. 
Usually located in C:\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Android\sdk

Edit weather.js in src/util/weather.js if current appid is not working.
